1071408947935002624	@mirtha_monge @Space_Station @NASA @SpaceX @takumiohno No sex in space, at least with a partner, due to Newton's third law. If the couple remain attached, their movements will counter each other. Consequently, their actions will not change their velocity unless they are affected by another, unattached, object.

1071408968910733313	@LarryBoorstein @washingtonpost All of which, even if it were true (we don’t know, this is simply what Cohen told Mueller), never amounted to anything. Cohen also had zero details (in case anyone wanted to bother to research) on connections to any Russian.

1071408973117575168	.@YouTube sure is trying to get me to subscribe to Premium. It feels like I’m now seeing ads every couple of minutes on 5+ minute videos, which is kind of jarring.
